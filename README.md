  A web experiment of AI voice agents and visual interactions.
</p>

---

Eleven was started as an exploratory hacking project after some development in the voice space. The project has evolved into something that others showed interest in so we've decided to open it up for everyone. If you'd like to see this evolve even further we'd love the help! Please contribute!

**NOTE**
This uses experimental APIs which means you will need to use the latest version of Chrome. When viewing the demo you need to enable the microphone and speak clearly when issuing voice commands.

## Features
* **Pluggable** Provides an easy interface to quickly build plugins for any Eleven agent.
* **Rules** Supports explicit rule-based command matching and AI engines (api.ai, wit.ai, ... etc).
* **Flexible** APIs are highly configurable, extensible and customizable.
* **Speech APIs** Powered by [SpeechRecognition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) and [SpeechSynthesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) interface of the Web Speech APIs.
